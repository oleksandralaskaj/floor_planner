# Floor planning app

## An app created as a web development bootcamp final project, striving to solve a real issue

Floor Planner emerged from my desire to bridge the gap for non-professionals seeking an intuitive floor plan tool. As a junior developer, I empathized with real estate agents and homeowners struggling to visualize spaces. Inspired by their challenges, I tried to create a solution, that will provide with both a good user experience and professional outputs.

**Used technologies:**
- Laravel
- React
- Typescript
- Sass
- React Konva library
